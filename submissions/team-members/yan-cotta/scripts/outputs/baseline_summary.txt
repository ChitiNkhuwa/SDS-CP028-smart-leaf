Baseline Performance (Step 2)
- Average Validation Loss: 0.487
- Average F1-score: 0.739
- Strong Classes (F1 > 0.9): Corn___Common_Rust, Corn___Healthy, Potato___Early_Blight, Potato___Late_Blight, Rice___Neck_Blast
- Problematic Classes (F1 < 0.7): Rice___Leaf_Blast (0.2975), Rice___Healthy (0.4978), Rice___Brown_Spot (0.5184), Corn___Gray_Leaf_Spot (0.5237), Corn___Northern_Leaf_Blight (0.6895)
- Observations:
  - Class imbalance affects minority classes (e.g., Rice___Leaf_Blast: ~100 samples).
  - Rice___Healthy underperforms despite high samples (~1488), likely due to confusion with other rice diseases.
  - Validation loss (~0.487) indicates underfitting; more epochs or tuning needed.
  - Confusion matrices show misclassifications, especially among rice classes.

  Step 3: Oversampling and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Initial oversampling (SMOTE) reduced F1 to 0.6365 and increased validation loss to 2.7789, indicating overfitting.
- Hyperparameter tuning tested lr=[0.01, 0.001, 0.0001], dropout=[0.7, 0.5, 0.3], batch_size=[16, 32].
- Best tuned result (lr=0.001, dropout=0.5, batch_size=32): F1 = 0.6333.
- Final refinement: lr=0.001, dropout=0.3, batch_size=32, epochs=10, class weights instead of oversampling.
- Result: [Insert F1 and validation loss from your run here].
- Conclusion: [e.g., Improved stability, F1 approaching baseline, etc.].
