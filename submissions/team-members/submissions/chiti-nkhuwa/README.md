# 🌿 Smart Leaf: Multi-Crop Disease Detection

This project uses deep learning to classify plant leaf diseases across **four major crops** — **Corn, Potato, Rice, and Wheat** — covering **14 distinct disease and healthy classes**.  

The final model was trained on over **13,000 images** and achieved strong performance on a balanced test set using a fully custom-built convolutional neural network (CNN).

## 📊 Classes

| Crop    | Classes                                      |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| Corn    | Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, Northern Leaf Blight, Healthy |
| Potato  | Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy           |
| Rice    | Brown Spot, Leaf Blast, Neck Blast, Healthy  |
| Wheat   | Brown Rust, Yellow Rust, Healthy             |

## 🧠 Model Development

We trained and evaluated multiple models, culminating in a custom CNN (Attempt 4) with:

- 🏗️ 3 Convolutional blocks with BatchNorm, Dropout, and L2 regularization  
- 📉 Learning rate reduction & early stopping  
- 🎯 Final test accuracy: **~87.2%**  

Model architecture and training were completed in **Google Colab**, and Gradio was used to prototype deployment.
